Dash is a male Devon Rex with short, curly fur. His fur is a bit thin and he has a little bald spot on the top of his head that he likes to get scratched. Dash is very clever and receptive to training. He can scratch, spin clockwise and stand on command. Dash can also jump through a hula hoop 4 feet high!
